# The Written Analysis.

# Surfs_up. 

## Overview of the statistical analysis:

W. Avy agrees with our study, but he needs additional data on temperature changes before launching the surf store. He is specifically interested in temperature data for the months of June and December on Oahu in order to establish whether the surf and ice cream store business can be sustained year-round. This new project includes two technical analysis deliverables as well as a written report. 

## Results: 

1- June's average temperature is around 76- 78 째F. The weathre is usally good in June. And hopefully the surf and ice-cream business can go suncessfull in this month.

2- December's average temperature is around 64 to 76 째F. The weather is usually cold in december. But still better than starting months of the year. The surf and ice-cream business can take a turnover in this month.

3- June is somewhat warmer than December on average, however this might be due to the fact that June has more datapoints than December.The average temperature in June is 74 degrees Fahrenheit, while in December it is 71 degrees Fahrenheit. 

## Summary: 

Based on the findings, we can assume that the temperatures in June and December are comparable and would be acceptable for surfing all year. However, there are two areas of worry. The first is the lowest temperature for December, which was 56 째F. While surfing is more than doable at this temperature and would most certainly not dissuade serious aficionados, it is unlikely that tourists or beginners would want to try it. The minimum temperature for December, on the other hand, contrasts substantially from the average temperature for the month, which is 71 째F and much more of a nice temperature for surfing and eating ice cream.
